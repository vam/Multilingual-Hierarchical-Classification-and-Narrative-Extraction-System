How to Execute the codes

All code files(Task_1.ipynb, Task_2.ipynb, Task_3.ipynb) has to be executed in Google colab.

## Subtask-1 (Classification Task):

(i) Upload the dataset(target_4_December_release.zip) from this folder into Google colab and rename the dataset to **train.zip**.

(ii) Now run all the cells in **Task_1.ipynb** file and see the results.


## Subtask-2 (Narrative & Sub-narrative Classification):

(i) Upload the dataset(target_4_December_release.zip) and NARRATIVE-TAXONOMIES.pdf file from this folder into Google colab and rename the dataset to **train.zip**.

(ii) Now run all the cells in **Task_2.ipynb** file and see the results.


## Subtask-3 (Explanation Generation):

(i) Upload the dataset(target_4_December_release.zip) from this folder into Google colab and rename the dataset to **train.zip**.

(ii) Now run all the cells in **Task_3.ipynb** file and see the results.
