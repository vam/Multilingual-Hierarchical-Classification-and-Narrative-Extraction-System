изкопаеми горива и увеличите парникови газове са виновни за температурните аномалии лято 2024 ни похлупи с адска жега която по тези ширини ужасени сравняваме с пустинната юни беше потопъл а още изживяваме и юлските екстремни жеги много вероятно е това лято да бъде потопло от миналогодишното което бе третото найгорещо лято за последните години в българия 2023 г беше и найгорещата година в световен мащаб а у нас е била найтоплата от 1930 г насам говорим за топлинен купол под който са сърбия гърция румъния българия но и украйна в тях беше издаден код червено защото горещият период се задържа 17 дни заради антициклоналното състояние на атмосферата  ясно и чисто небе високо атмосферно налягане стабилна атмосфера до края на юли температурите ще са попоносими подобни екстремни горещини се случват когато в страната нахлува топъл въздух от северна африка в съчетание с фьонов ефект при такива ситуации се създават условия за много високи температури така е измерена и найвисоката максимална температура на въздуха у нас  в садово през 1916 г 452 градуса фьонов ефект може да се наблюдава не само по подветрената страна а и от двете страни на планината  това е проява на тнар антициклонален фьон заради слягането на въздуха в антициклона този вятър утежнява горещите вълни и подпомага развитието на пожари каквито вече се случиха в някои населени места напоследък много се говори за магнитните бури и за зловредната активност на слънцето но няма връзка между тях и горещото време изгарянето на изкопаеми горива и увеличението на парниковите газове в атмосферата е главният виновник за температурните аномалии днес а с глобалното затопляне зачестяват и екстремните явления честотата на екстремните прояви на времето у нас се е увеличила с 30 в периода 19912007 г спрямо базисния период 19611990 г според климатичните модели през 2050 г екстремните метеорологични явления ще се утроят по принцип новият климат се измества към потопъл но и кривата на нормалното разпределение тнар разпределение на гаус се смачква като средните стойности намаляват а крайните се увеличават заради това че кривата се измества към потоплата част от скалата ще намалеят свързаните със студа явления а рязко ще се увеличат свързаните с топлината много се говори за природни цикли в които похладните и погорещите лета се редуват през 1015 г цикличност съществува но не можем само с нея да обясняваме огромното затопляне на земята през последните десетилетия климатолози установиха че промяната в температурите заради естествените цикли е десета от градуса затова в никакъв случай не може да се твърди че затоплянето което наблюдаваме днес е резултат на естествена причина коментират се много и астрономическите фактори промените в параметрите на земната орбита и наклона на земната ос дрейфът на континентите вулканичните изригвания и промените в океанските течения и найвече промените в слънчевата активност като причина за затоплянето вероятно тези промени са в резултат на стотици хиляди години и влияят за толкова няма обаче друго обяснение на рязкото затопляне през последните десетилетия освен с парниковите емисии факт е че климатът в българия е погорещ даже има прогнози че след десетилетия ще се доближава до този в ливан но много зависи дали ще се осъществят найлошите или найдобрите сценарии за затоплянето на климата на земята лошият сценарий е средната температура на въздуха на земята до края на ххi век да е с 56 градуса над прединдустриалната а имаме много малко време за да го предотвратим  между 5 и 8 години според оценките на климатолозите 2 градуса са точката на пречупване отвъд която глобалното затопляне ще стане необратимо и вече няма да може да се направи нищо тогава човечеството може да стане свидетел на много драматични събития трябва да се спре изгарянето на изкопаеми горива и да се намалят емисиите по найбързия възможен начин не е ясно обаче дали сме технологично готови да сторим това в световен мащаб доста голяма е

установено е че 50 от мигрените се дължат на рязка промяна във времето такава промяна имаме когато средноденонощните температури се променят с повече от 6 градуса от предния ден или с 2 градуса но при

abusive/exploitative | Context: treasury dept makes rule determination undermining premise of ev tax credits within inflation reduction act    we accept the named legislation inflation reduction act ira is a legislative misnomer intended to obfuscate the true construct of the bill the ira was factually the green new deal program packaged under the guise of an inflation reduction premise however in order to discuss the outcome of the content we have to play the game of pretending around the purpose of the legislation  within the ira there was a 7500 tax credit for american made electric vehicles the intent of the legislation was to provide incentives for us consumers to purchase sustainable and environmentally friendly electric cars trucks suvs etc made in america  the congressional budget office cbo scored the bill with this legislative intent in mind however the treasury department is now taking apart the granular details of the legislation in order to qualify foreign made vehicles for the 7500 credit the rules interpretation from the treasury dept essentially negates the cbo score and the outcome is going to be much more expensive than initially stated  because the 7500 comes in the form of a tax credit the irs treasury is the institution making the determinations for qualification treasury is changing the qualifications to permit basically any ev to qualify by parsing a difference between a leased vehicle and a purchased vehicle additionally treasury is changing the battery sourcing aspect by qualifying essentially any trade agreement as a free trade agreement fta saying the term free trade agreement was undefined in the legislation  as an outcome  simply cutting to the chase ev batteries from just about anywhere inside ev vehicles from basically anywhere that are purchased as leases from just about any auto manufacturer will qualify for the 7500 credit its all a shell game with the biden administration determining where the pea is located  dec 29 reuters  the us treasury department said thursday that electric vehicles leased by consumers starting jan 1 can qualify for up to 7500 in commercial clean vehicle tax credits a decision that makes those assembled outside north america eligible  the announcement is a win for south korea and some automakers that earlier this month sought approval to use the commercial electric vehicle tax credit to boost consumer ev access automakers said the credit could be used to reduce leasing prices  the 430 billion us inflation reduction act ira passed in august ended 7500 consumer tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles assembled outside north america angering south korea the european union japan and others the new treasury guidance does not change the definition of what constitutes north american assembly to make more vehicles eligible for ev purchases  treasury said it was using longstanding tax principles to determine consumer leasing could qualify for the ev tax credit  the ira also imposes significant battery minerals and component sourcing restrictions sets income and price caps for qualifying vehicles and seeks to phase out chinese battery minerals or components the commercial credit does not however have the sourcing restrictions of the consumer credit  senator joe manchin a democrat who chairs the chambers energy panel urged treasury to pause implementation of both commercial and new consumer ev tax credits and said they had bent to the desires of the companies looking for loopholes and would seek new legislation that prevents this dangerous interpretation from treasury from moving forward read more  from the wall street journal one of the documents released thursday pointed out that because the legislation doesnt define what a freetrade agreement is the treasury department might consider other types of trade agreements to expand the eligibility the department didnt provide examples of such agreements but trade lawyers have suggested that the 2019 bilateral trade agreement with japan and the world trade organizations government procurement agreement could be candidates link  i am reminded of the words from democrat congressman alcee hastings
